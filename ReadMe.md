# This is my local repo
A local repository is a version-controlled directory on your computer where project files and their revision history are stored. It is created using Git and allows developers to track changes, commit updates, and manage code locally before pushing changes to a remote repository. A local repository typically includes:

Working directory: Where project files are stored and modified.

Staging area (Index): Where changes are prepared before committing.

Git directory (.git folder): Contains all version history, configurations, and metadata.

Developers use local repositories to work offline, experiment with changes, and ensure code stability before synchronizing with remote repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
